* 💹 Stocks & ETFs – aligned with user investment goals
* 🏦 Loans & Credit Products – personalized to income, risk & credit score
* 🛡 Insurance Plans – based on coverage needs and affordability

This project adapts state-of-the-art recommendation architectures for finance-driven personalization and business intelligence.
